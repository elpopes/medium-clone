This is a clone of Medium, a platform for sharing stories. The app allows users to create, read, and interact with articles on a wide range of topics about Tolkien's Middle-Earth.

## Technologies Used:

- React
- Redux
- Ruby on Rails
- PostgreSQL
- AWS S3

## Features:

### Article Creation

One of the key features of Medium is the ability for users to create and publish their own articles and photos.

We implemented image uploading, integrated with AWS S3. Users are able to upload and embed images in their articles.

One of the main challenges we faced was ensuring that the content created by the editor would render correctly on the article page. This requires extensive styling with CSS.

### User CRUD

Another key feature of Medium is the ability for users to update their profile information. This again included the integration of AWS S3.
